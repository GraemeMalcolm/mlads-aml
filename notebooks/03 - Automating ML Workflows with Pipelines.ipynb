In reality, you could build more sophisticated logic into the pipeline steps - for example, evaluating the model against some test data to calculate a performance metric like AUC or accuracy, comparing the metric to that of any previously registered versions of the model, and only registering the new model if it performs better. You can even [schedule pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-schedule-pipelines) to run a specified times. For more information about Azure ML Pipelines, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-ml-pipelines).\n",

For example you could use an Azure DevOps *build* pipeline to trigger an Azure ML pipeline that trains and registers a model, and when the model is registered it could trigger an Azure Devops *release* pipeline that deploys the model as a web service, along with the application or service that consumes the model."
